# php5-fpm-install
PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language.

This script is supposed to build and create a neat package allowing easy redistribution and uninstallation.
We don't use default path on purpose to allow you to run php5 alongside another major version of PHP.

Pull request are welcome.
